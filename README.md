This Malware Collection was made only for <b>educational purposes</b>, like malware analysis, pentesting, security researchs, etc.

Given that we are dealing with malware, do not run this on any machine if you do not have experience or know what you are doing. Malware is not a joke (ps: some yes) and can even steal personal information, spy, damage data or even spread to other computers and cause widespread infection. Remarking that everything here is unsafe.

If you decide to execute any malware, always make sure that you are taking all security measures to prevent the damages mentioned earlier. In case of compromised data/information/networks/computers, I will not be held responsible for any actions, precisely because this warning is clear about the risks involved.
